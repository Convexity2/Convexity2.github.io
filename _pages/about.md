I have a bachelor's degree in Internet of Things Engineering from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) and [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) . I am currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Science at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My research interests lie in the fields of natural language processing and deep learning. In particular, I am interested in large language models.
